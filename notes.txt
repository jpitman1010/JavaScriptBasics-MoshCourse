best practices: 

to open on live server (web browser) go to HTML file and right click on document, then click 
open with live server


1. to start a document, type ! then press tab, it creates
base HTML required.

2. to add tags, type in tag name (without < to start) then 
press tab, it will create the open and closing tags.

3. place script tags in the body 
right above ending tag, below all code
    a. browser parses file from top to bottom.
    so it won't be able to render content and give
    bad user experience.
    b. makes sure all elements are rendered by  browser.
    c. as best practice JavaScript goes at bottom, some 3rd party
    applications require it to be in header section.

4. HTML == content
5. JavaScript == behavior of content
6. to run in node, open terminal and type node filename and it will run the 
JavaScript in the terminal.


7. use single quotes when declairing something
in JavaScript.  i.e. let name = 'Julie';

8.  Naming variables 
    -cannot use a reserved keyword. 
    . if
    . var
    . let
    etc...

    -use meaningful and descriptive names
    . don't use p= or r = , etc...

    -cannot start with a number
    -cannot contain a space or hyphen
    -camelCase should be used
    -variables are case-sensitive
    -you can declair 2+ variables on same line 
    separating with a comma
    .  let firstName = 'Julie', lastName = 'Pitman';
    . HOWEVER, best practice is to separate them into 2 lines!



9.  using const means that you cannot reassign the value
    
10. Primitive/Value Types
    -strings
    -numbers
    -booleans
    -undefined  (both a type and can be a value)
    -null (this type returns an object)


11. Dynamic Typing
    -type of variable can be changed, if it starts
    as a string, you can change it later 
    -in browser, under console log at > you can type in
    commands, i.e. if console logs name = Julie
    you can type in name = 1
    -then you can check typeof the variable by Typing
    typeof name; it will return number once reassigned like above.


-control L will clear console.


12. Objects 
    -Reference Types
        -Object
            -like a real life object. Objects have properties.  
                -a person for example, has properties of name, age, physical attributes, etc...

        -Array
        -Function

13. operators
    -Arithmetic operators
    -Assignment operators
    -Comparison operators
    -Logical operators
    -Bitwise operators
-operator variables
- expressions
-algorithms

14.  Javascript has 2 types of conditional statements:
    -if...else 
    -Switch...case

15. Loops in Javascript:
    -for
    -while
    -do...while
    -for...in
    -for...of
    
16. Value types and reference types
    Value Types:
        -number
        -string
        -boolean
        -symbol
        -undefined
        -null
    Rerference Types:
        -Objects
        -Functions
        -Arrays
